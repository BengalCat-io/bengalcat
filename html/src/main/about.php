            <h2>Learn in 10 minutes</h2>
            <p>You can probably learn all there is to know unique to the framework in 10 minutes, which either means it's really shitty or really easy.</p>

            <h2>No Community</h2>
            <p>Much like the household cat, this framework is indifferent about people, but very excited about independence. You should not install plugins; instead you should write the code yourself - for, dare I say, <i>fun</i>.</p>

            <h2>Forking is Encouraged</h2>
            <p>Learning how to write frameworks helps a ton when you use more complicated frameworks [see <a href="https://r.je/php-annotations-are-an-abomination.html" target="_blank">Annotations</a>]</p>

    <h1>Who is this for?</h1>
    <p>
        This minimal framework is basically Controller|View - no models.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For people who are not always working with a database.
        </li>
        <li>
            Or people who like to work with a database without an ORM.
        </li>
        <li>
            Or people who want a framework, but a really simple one - that they can hack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Or people who need to prototype a proof of concept quickly.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The idea is the framework (outside of server side setup) should only take a few minutes to get the developer coding.</p>
    
    <p>
        And furthermore, <strong>that the learning curve should be about 10 minutes</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>More ideas of what you're doing with BengalCat</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Maybe you are using it to write some worker scripts you'll never touch after your task is complete, like a personal sandbox.
        </li>
        <li>
            Or you are writing a quick API and need _something_ without a lot of overhead. (You need to write your own api auth!)
        </li>
        <li>
            Or working with multiple databases and despise ORMs for that.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Angela Murrell</strong> spent an entire weekend in front of a computer to code what she's been envisioning as a fun sandbox / quick prototype solution to overly-complex frameworks.</p>
